 * @brief Convolution of Q15 sequences.   
 * @param[in] *pSrcA points to the first input sequence.   
 * @param[in] srcALen length of the first input sequence.   
 * @param[in] *pSrcB points to the second input sequence.   
 * @param[in] srcBLen length of the second input sequence.   
 * @param[out] *pDst points to the location where the output result is written.  Length srcALen+srcBLen-1.   
 * @return none.   
 *   
 * @details   
 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>   
 *   
 * \par   
 * The function is implemented using a 64-bit internal accumulator.   
 * Both inputs are in 1.15 format and multiplications yield a 2.30 result.   
 * The 2.30 intermediate results are accumulated in a 64-bit accumulator in 34.30 format.   
 * This approach provides 33 guard bits and there is no risk of overflow.   
 * The 34.30 result is then truncated to 34.15 format by discarding the low 15 bits and then saturated to 1.15 format.   
 *   
 * \par   
 * Refer to <code>riscv_conv_fast_q15()</code> for a faster but less precise version of this function for Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4. 
 *
 * \par    
 * Refer the function <code>riscv_conv_opt_q15()</code> for a faster implementation of this function using scratch buffers.
